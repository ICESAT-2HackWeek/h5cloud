# H5Test

The H5Test Class is intended to be used as a parent class for various benchmark tests for H5 formats. It includes a wrapper for timing results and writing them to S3. See examples for how to use it and run it in [`h5py_arr_len.py`](h5py_arr_len.py) and [notebooks/example-test-run.ipynb](./notebooks/example-test-run.ipynb). Read results with [notebooks/read-results.ipynb](./notebooks/read-results.ipynb).
